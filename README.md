# Radiacode-map-plotter
Simple python program to plot ALL your radiacode tracks in a simple map. Simply chuck your track-files in the folder, convert them, and press go.

Old preview of code. I intermittently upload tracks to my own website at https://iver.sobakk.no/radiacode

## Todo:
 - Include option for interpolation within an area <br>
 - Organize folders better (all rctrk folders within a main rctrk folder, and same with csv) for simpler conversion of files. As is, you have to convert each folder manually. <br>
 - Include option for crowd-contributed tracks <br>
 - Some form of optimization. There are a LOT of dots, and the HTML file is big and slow. Might consider collapsing datapoints within a certain proximity to an average or similar
